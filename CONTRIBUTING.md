## Testing

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to opengovernment](https://github.com/andmhn/climate-awareness/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, 
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit"
    > 
    > "A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Project conventions

Start reading our code and rule. We optimize for readability:

  * We use React to make this project.
  * If you don't know React. then only edit (site) folder for normal HTML, CSS we rewrite the code into react.
  * If you add something like : image/video then put it in public folder only.
